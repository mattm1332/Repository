How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I would take user stories to help me figure out what the user would like in the program. A user story will ask customers exactly what they would like to have in the program and breaks it down into a way for the development team to create it within the program. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I will always use an agile process when creating a program. I think the most important aspect of the agile method is the daily scrum meetings. You need to have open discussions with your team to ensure you are all on the same page and on track to complete the project on time. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is to help others in the team. It also means upholding your end of the bargain and meeting deadlines that are set. You also want to be able to hold others accountable to what they say they will get done. You should also always be teaching the other team members by correcting any issues you may see.
